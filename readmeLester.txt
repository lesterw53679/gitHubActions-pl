Cloned from: https://github.com/patrickloeber/python-github-action-template

1. Go to GitHub, create an empty repo, lets call it 'gitHubActions-pl'
    my repo: https://github.com/lesterw53679/gitHubActions-pl
2. from VSCode clone the repo from patrickloeber to put it on local machine
    git clone https://github.com/patrickloeber/python-github-action-template.git
3. Lets explore virtual environments: from VSCode make any changes you want to your repo, explore the yaml file in the .github/workflows folder
    Lets create a virtual environment for the project
    //from terminal run:
        python -m venv venv
    //from terminal run:
        venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    // to deactivate the environment 
        deactivate

About virtual environments: 

https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv#Python_venv_activation

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31684375/automatically-create-file-requirements-txt

    // If you are creating this app from scratch you can create the main.py file
    
    // then you can use the pip freeze command puts all dependencies in your virtual environment

    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    

    //If you want to generate a minimal requirements.txt that only lists the dependencies you need, then use the pipreqs package
    
    //First from the terminal take a look at what you have in your virtual environment
    
    pip3 list 
    python --version

    // Install pipreqs
    pip3 install pipreqs

    pipreqs ./   //this will create a minimal requirements.txt file from the imports of your python files

    // This is the syntax for using pipreqs
    pipreqs [path to folder]
    e.g. pipreqs .
     pipreqs ./ --force --ignore=tests (Overwrites exisiting requirements.txt, ignores the tests directory)



// problems with not finding the module check its location
    pip show packagename
example: pip show requests

Note the dependencies that I installed were getting added to the global site-packages folder instead of the one inside the venv, so the code running inside this env was not able to access those dependencies.

To solve this problem, just remove the venv folder and recreate it again, like so:
$ deactivate
$ rm -rf venv
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt




4. initialize the git repo, stage the files and do a first commit (open terminal and run the following commands)
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
5. check the remote connection and if needed set it to your gitHub account repo
    
    git remote get-url origin

    you will notice it may still be pointing to the remote repository we copied it from to our local machine
    https://github.com/patrickloeber/python-github-action-template.git

    Set the remote to your own gitHub repo
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/lesterw53679/gitHubActions-pl

git remote set-url origin https://<username>:<password>@github.com/<username>/FirstRepository.git

// the above syntax is used to pass your credentials

6. lets explore some other git commmands

    git branch    //this will list all the branches in your project (only main at this point)
    git branch newFeature  //this will create a new branch in your local project called 'newFeature'
    git branch    // now you will see we have two branches
    git checkout newFeature  //this will activate branch 
    git branch       //see which branch is highlighted
    git checkout main  //switch back to the main branch
    git branch -D newFeature   //delete this branch, we're not going to do anything with it right now

    (we've added a file modified it since we last staged and commit, lets do that first)
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"

7. Push to gitHub
    git push -u origin main    // this will push all the changes to gitHub

8. Pull from remote  

// To see how this works go to GitHub, add a file or two directly in the online GitHub repo.  Once you do that you can pull these changes using the pull command:  
    git pull origin main

9. Branching:  Lets try branching and doing a pull request
    git checkout -b development
 (now we are local and sitting on the "development" branch, make some modifications to files)

    git add .
    git commit -m "branch development"
    git push origin development


10. Merge Branch: Go back to GitHub and do a compare and pull, this will trigger the action because we are doing a pull and compare on this

    select the branch you want to merge into the main branch
    compare the differences, check that we have successfully passed all the tests

 11. Bring your local project up to date:
    git pull origin main    //now your local is up to date, merged branches

    if you need to delete the branch manually:
    git branch -D development

12. Note on doing matrix
on: [push, workflow_dispatch]
    branches: [main, development]
   
   branches:
      - "main"  
      - "development"


13. Install the GitHub actions extension for VSCode
    (this will make it easier to do work with actions from VSCode)
14. Break the code, raise Exception()
